USDL Pricing API
===============

The USDL Pricing API is a library that aims at reducing the gap between programmers and the Linked USDL Pricing model. The API works as an abstraction layer between the developer and the model providing the means to programatically interact with it. With this tool we hope to leverage the Linked USDL usage by everyone interested in describing their services prices. 


**NOTE**: This repository is temporary and holds only tryouts of the project feasability. At the time of the first release the project will be migrated to its own Linked USDL repository.
